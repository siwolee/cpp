### Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, easyfind.{h, hpp}
and optional file: easyfind.tpp
Write a function template easyfind that accepts a type T. It takes two parameters.
"""cpp
template <typename T>
function easyfind<T>(T type, int)
"""
The first one has type T and the second one is an integer.
Assuming T is a container of integers, this function has to find the first occurrence
of the second parameter in the first parameter.
If no occurrence is found, you can either throw an exception or return an error value
of your choice. If you need some inspiration, analyze how standard containers behave.
Of course, implement and turn in your own tests to ensure everything works as expected.

### Makefile, main.cpp, Span.{h, hpp}, Span.cpp
Develop a Span class that can store a maximum of N integers. N is an unsigned int
variable and will be the only parameter passed to the constructor.
This class will have a member function called addNumber() to add a single number
to the Span. It will be used in order to fill it. Any attempt to add a new element if there
are already N elements stored should throw an exception.
Next, implement two member functions: shortestSpan() and longestSpan()
They will respectively find out the shortest span or the longest span (or distance, if
you prefer) between all the numbers stored, and return it. If there are no numbers stored,
or only one, no span can be found. Thus, throw an exception.
Of course, you will write your own tests and they will be way more thorough than the
ones below. Test your Span at least with a minimum of 10 000 numbers. More would be
even better.

| Running this code:
""" cpp
int main()
{
Span sp = Span(5);
sp.addNumber(6);
sp.addNumber(3);
sp.addNumber(17);
sp.addNumber(9);
sp.addNumber(11);
std::cout << sp.shortestSpan() << std::endl;
std::cout << sp.longestSpan() << std::endl;
return 0;
}
Should output:
$> ./ex01
2
14
$>
"""
Last but not least, it would be wonderful to fill your Span using a range of iterators.
Making thousands calls to addNumber() is so annoying. Implement a member function
to add many numbers to your Span in one call.
If you donâ€™t have a clue, study the Containers. Some member
functions take a range of iterators in order to add a sequence of
elements to the container.
